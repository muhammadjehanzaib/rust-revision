# Let's begin revision of Rust
# Welcome to Rust!

This repository serves as a starting point for exploring the Rust programming language. Rust is a systems programming language known for its safety, speed, and concurrency. It empowers developers to build high-performance, reliable, and efficient software.

**Key Features of Rust:**

* **Memory Safety:** Rust's unique ownership and borrowing system prevents common memory-related bugs like segfaults and data races, without relying on garbage collection.
* **Performance:** Rust code can be compiled to highly optimized machine code, offering performance comparable to C and C++.
* **Concurrency:** Rust provides powerful tools for writing concurrent and parallel code safely and efficiently.
* **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** Rust allows you to write expressive and concise code without sacrificing performance.

**Project Goals:**

This project aims to:

* **Learn the fundamentals of Rust:** Explore core concepts like ownership, borrowing, data structures, and control flow.
* **Build practical examples:** Develop small projects to demonstrate Rust's capabilities and gain hands-on experience.
* **Explore advanced topics:** Dive deeper into areas like concurrency, macros, and working with external libraries.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install Rust:**

   - **Using rustup (recommended):**
      - Download and install rustup from the official website: https://rustup.rs/
      - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust and its associated tools.
   - **Installing rustup on Linux or macOS:**
      - If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:
      ```bash
      $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
      ```

   - **Verify installation:**
      - Open your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        rustc --version
        ```
        You should see the installed Rust version.

2. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadjehanzaib/rust-revision.git
